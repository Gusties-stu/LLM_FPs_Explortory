# Fermi Question 
LLM for Complex Reasoning Task:An Exploratory Study in Fermi Problems

Fermi Problems (FPs) are mathematical rea-
soning tasks that require human-like logic and
numerical reasoning. Unlike other reasoning
questions, FPs often involve real-world imprac-
ticalities or ambiguous concepts, making them
challenging even for humans to solve. Despite
advancements in AI, particularly with large
language models (LLMs) in various reason-
ing tasks, FPs remain relatively under-explored.
This work conducted an exploratory study to ex-
amine the capabilities and limitations of LLMs
in solving FPs. We first evaluated the overall
performance of three advanced LLMs using a
publicly available FP dataset. We designed
prompts according to the recently proposed
TELeR taxonomy, including a zero-shot sce-
nario. Results indicated that all three LLMs
achieved a fp_score (range between 0 - 1) be-
low 0.5, underscoring the inherent difficulty
of these reasoning tasks. To further investi-
gate, we categorized FPs into standard and
specific questions, hypothesizing that LLMs
would perform better on standard questions,
which are characterized by clarity and concise-
ness, than on specific ones. Comparative exper-
iments confirmed this hypothesis, demonstrat-
ing that LLMs performed better on standard
FPs in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.
